# Badge Controller

##### Summary

This is a MERN stack application with Heroku deployment that serves the need of my colleagues working at the front desk. 

We are a secure facility and access to buildings and elevators is restricted via magnetic-scan key cards. Employees have cards that are programmed with the appropriate access permissions for their role, however we have many daily visitors or employees with forgotten cards that require a temporary pass.

The front desk staff keeps a supply of key cards that can be checked out, but for security and tracking down we need to capture information about the person for each check-out.

My React.JS and Mongo database solution aims to replace the current spreadsheet used to log this information, by making it quicker and easier to enter people's information, while also generating a more robust record of badge usage and borrowers that could be used to improve the overall process.
